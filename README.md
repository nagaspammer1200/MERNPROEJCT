This website is a web portal for study materials for students of my College. This project also served as a way for me to learn MERN stack. 

Technologies used in this project include:

        React JS
        Tailwind CSS
        Github
        Animate On Scroll Library

In crafting the visual identity of our video game news network site, we leveraged the extensive libraries of icons from Bootstrap, carefully selecting and integrating these design elements to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. Links to their websites are given below:

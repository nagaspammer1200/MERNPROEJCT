Welcome to Pixel Pulse, a visually stunning video game news network site crafted with a focus on exceptional user experience. By harnessing the capabilities of React JS to build a dynamic and responsive interface, and Tailwind CSS to create a bespoke design language, this project showcases the perfect blend of form and function. With Git version control ensuring seamless collaboration and BlackBoxAI's AI-driven insights informing our design decisions, we're redefining the front-end of video game news and discovery.
The Page performance was optimized by leveraging the technology of LazyLoadImage.

Technologies used in this project include:

        React JS
        Tailwind CSS
        Github
